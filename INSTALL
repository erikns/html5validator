INSTALLATION
---------------------

html5validator depends on the 'requests' library. Make shure you install it
before you attempt to run the tool.

Place the file anywhere you like manually :)

The html5validator contains a hashbang line, so executing it directly
from your command shell should run it correctly.

NOTE:

Make shure the folder where you place the file is in your PATH. Then you can
invoke the utility from anywhere by issuing html5validator [file] in your
command shell.
