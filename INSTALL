INSTALLATION
---------------------

OPTION 1:

Run the install.sh script (bash). It will place the python file in /bin under
the current users home folder without the .py extension

OPTION 2:

Place the file anywhere you like manually :)

NOTE:

Make shure the folder where you place the file is in your PATH. Then you can
invoke the utility from anywhere by issuing html5validator [file] in your
command shell.
